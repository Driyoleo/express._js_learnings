useRef() : 

- useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed for rendering.
- also the value of can be used accross rendering

- note :  if the value of ref is changing overtime then it should not be used in the DOM cause
          it doesn't render the page and in strict mode of react it creats error

- uses : 
        - Referencing a value with a ref
                - eg.
                - first importing useRef,
                                import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'

                - then defining it on top level of function
                                const a = useRef(0)         // initial value = 0 

                - now changing it whenever we want only in the top level of function
                                a.current=a.current + 1

        - Manipulating the DOM with a ref
                - eg.
                - first importing useRef,
                                import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'
                
                - then defining a variable useRef
                                const btnref = useRef()
                
                - giving it the reference of the element we want to target
                                <button ref={btnref}>

                - modifying the element from top level as we want
                                btnref.current.style.backgroundColor = "red"
