# form handling in react :
- this helps to do form validation very easy for us we don't have to spent much time and energy in it,
- to setup it we have to do following things : 

~ step 1:
    Installing React Hook Form only takes a single command and you're ready to roll.
    by  :  npm install react-hook-form

~ step 2 : 
    import {useForm} from "react-hook-form"

~ step 3 :
    define this on the top level,
        const {
        register,
        handleSubmit,
        watch,
        formState: { errors },
        } = useForm()

~ step 4 :
    inside the form we need to write in this way 
    
      <input {...register("firstname")} type="text" placeholder='firstname' />
      <input {...register("secondname")} type="text" placeholder='secondname' />
      <input type="submit" value="submit" />

      - we don't have to give value and other things 
      - just do this {...register("firstname")}

~ step 5 : 
    then we have to define onSubmit like this ...
    <form action='' onSubmit={handleSubmit((data)=>{console.log(data)})}>
