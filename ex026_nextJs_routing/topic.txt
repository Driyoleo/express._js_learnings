here i am gonna learn about the file based routing of next js 
- it reduces our additional work and keep our work as simple and possible with multi pages app
- suppose if i want a pet store website and i want different pages of that ..
- i can just simply for different pages i have to do :
    1. create named(name of the page) new file inside app folder
    2. create page.js and provide the html content inside it of that page
    then.. it will be automatically visible on that route due to next js
